# ActivitiesDB
### Your personal online guidance counselor

ActivitiesDB is a website I am building to help high school students find educational oppurtunities. Users can browse our database of activities and save them to their account. To help in finding the best activities for users, I have implemented a tag filter feature.

The following are screenshots of the website in its current form. There is still a lot of work to do, including adding more features and drastically updating the UI. I hope to one day release the website to the public.

The current homescreen is pretty plain, but it quickly conveys all the information the user needs to know.

I have only created 3 activities as of now since I wanted to test other features before I add a lot of activities.

The feature also supports filtering by many tags at once. I will add many more tags in the future. Tags are stored in a collection in the database so it is easy to add and update tags.
