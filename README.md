# ActivitiesDB
### Your personal online guidance counselor

ActivitiesDB is a website I am building to help high school students find educational oppurtunities. Users can browse our database of activities and save them to their account. To help in finding the best activities for users, I have implemented a tag filter feature. The following are screenshots of the website in its current form. There is still a lot of work to do, including adding more features and drastically updating the UI.
